# Strong-Disorder-Renormalization-Group
This is the repository for the final project of the course Advanced Methods for Many-body Physics on Strongly Disordered Renormalization Group.

Tasks:
    Eric: Read paper + numerics + profit 
    Yiyuan: Heisenberg numerics
    Stefano: Theory simulation

general todo/ timeline:
    - Finish primary Heisenberg Numerics and get a good theory view by 27.11 maybe find another "simple" model to work with
    - Work out secondary model, eg 2d random ising or random walk etc. Maybe classical? Or another quantum
    - play around with 2 d flows, we should probably have a presentable result before we do that tho
