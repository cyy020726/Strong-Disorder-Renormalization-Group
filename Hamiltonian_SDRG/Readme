Here are the code relating to the Hamiltonian SDRG formalism applied to the spin-1/2 AF Heisenberg chain. The two jupyternotebooks can be used to understand the derivation of the flow equation. For comparison with the actual sampling of the model, we plot the flow equations over the sampled data in Distribution_sampling.py. The extraction of physical observables are carried out by Fisher_activated_scaling.py and Correlation_length.py. The numerics regarding the long-range model can be found in Long_range1.py (without flow equations) and Long_range2.py (with flow equations).
